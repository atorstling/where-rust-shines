# syntax
This is an introduction to syntax in Rust covering the syntax presented. Unlike other tasks this one contains no Java code of relevance, so jump straight into the Rust code.

## The task
In the file `rust/src/main.rs` there are a number of test cases that either fail or have code commented out, your job is to make all the tests passing without any code commented out.

To solve the tasks you should not have to use more than what was covered by the syntax presentation.

If you run into problems refer to the excellent [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-00-introduction.html) (from which all code examples are taken).
